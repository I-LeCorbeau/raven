.SH NAME
Raven \- a dynamic window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B raven
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Raven is a dynamic window manager for X, forked from Suckless' dwm. It manages windows in tiled,
monocle (stackmode) and floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimising the
environment for the application in use and the task performed.
.P
In tiled layouts windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area on the left contains one window by default, and the stacking area on the
right contains all other windows. The number of master area windows can be
adjusted from zero to an arbitrary number. In stackmode, all windows are
maximised to the screen size (minus gaps). In floating layout, windows can be resized
and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating, regardless of the
layout applied.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
Raven draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
prints version information to standard output, then exits.
.SH USAGE
.SS Status bar
.P
Raven reserves space at the top or bottom of the screen to display any status bar that has the 'override_redirect' 
option. The position and reserved space for the bar can ben set in config.h (barpos and barpadding).

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
Raven is customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
.SH PATCHING
.P
Raven is not meant to cover all use cases by default and makes no real assumptions as to how 
an individual wishes to manage windows. It is meant as a base which can be used to build 
a personalized window manager via patches.
.P
Patches are provided in the raven-patches repository. To submit a patch, open a pull request
in that repository. All guidelines on applying or submitting patches cna be found in the
repository's README.
.SH ISSUES
Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows
only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early
JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. Possible workarounds
are using JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or setting the
environment variable
.BR AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
(to use the older Motif backend instead) or running
.B xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set _NET_WM_NAME LG3D
or
.B wmname LG3D
(to pretend that a non-reparenting window manager is running that the
XToolkit/XAWT backend can recognize) or when using OpenJDK setting the environment variable
.BR _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 .
